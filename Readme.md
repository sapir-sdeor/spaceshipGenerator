**Design:**
Our design was simplistic, based on a single triangle pointing to the front, we than added a dome of sorts to give it some volume.
Our mesh design was inspired by Stealth Bomber jet planes.
We chose our texture to give it a sci-fi look.

**Given more time:**
We would have added more distinct wings and fins to the mesh.

*We did all of our work together, mostly on Erel's computer, that's why all but one of the commits are from it.
